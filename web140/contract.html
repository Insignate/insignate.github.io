      <p>I, Rafael Sandalo agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall, 2023, WEB140, N801, Web Development Tools with my instructor, Ella McManus.</p>
      <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
      <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
